# Clerk Integration Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Installed Clerk Package
- Added `@clerk/nextjs@latest` to the project dependencies

### 2. Updated Middleware (`middleware.ts`)
- Replaced Convex auth middleware with `clerkMiddleware()` from `@clerk/nextjs/server`
- Using the current App Router approach with proper matcher configuration
- Added public route protection using `createRouteMatcher` to exclude `/signin` and `/sign-up` routes from authentication requirement
- All other routes are now protected by default

### 3. Updated Root Layout (`app/layout.tsx`)
- Wrapped the application with `<ClerkProvider>`
- Added Clerk authentication components (`<SignedIn>`, `<SignedOut>`, `<SignInButton>`, `<SignUpButton>`, `<UserButton>`) in a header
- Note: Still wrapping with `ConvexAuthNextjsServerProvider` for backend Convex auth

### 4. Updated Sign-In Page (`app/signin/page.tsx`)
- Replaced custom Convex auth form with Clerk's `<SignIn>` component
- Simplified the sign-in experience using Clerk's hosted UI

### 5. Created Sign-Up Page (`app/sign-up/page.tsx`)
- Created new sign-up page using Clerk's `<SignUp>` component
- Matches the design and structure of the sign-in page

### 6. Updated Home Page (`app/page.tsx`)
- Switched from Convex auth hooks (`useConvexAuth`, `useAuthActions`) to Clerk hooks (`useAuth`)
- Updated `ProfileButton` and `SignOutButton` components to use Clerk's authentication state
- Implemented proper sign-out using Clerk's `signOut()` method
- Added Clerk authentication UI components to the header (`SignInButton`, `SignUpButton`, `UserButton`)

## Important Notes

### Dual Authentication System
The application currently uses **both** Clerk (frontend) and Convex Auth (backend):
- **Clerk**: Handles Next.js frontend authentication
- **Convex Auth**: Handles backend authentication for Convex functions

### Next Steps for Full Clerk Integration

To fully migrate from Convex Auth to Clerk, you'll need to:

1. **Update Convex Auth Configuration** (`convex/auth.ts`)
   - Integrate Clerk user information with Convex
   - Map Clerk user IDs to Convex user IDs
   - Or configure Convex to accept Clerk tokens

2. **Update Convex Functions** (`convex/userProfile.ts` and other files)
   - Replace `getAuthUserId` calls with Clerk-aware auth
   - Or implement middleware to sync Clerk users with Convex users

3. **Update Convex Client Provider** (`components/modules/ConvexClientProvider.tsx`)
   - Remove Convex auth provider if no longer needed
   - Ensure Convex client works with Clerk authentication

4. **Environment Variables**
   - Clerk will automatically generate keys on first run
   - No manual API key setup required

## Testing

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
   - You should see Clerk sign-in/sign-up buttons in the header
   - Click to authenticate with Clerk

3. Test the sign-in flow:
   - Navigate to `/signin`
   - Use Clerk's hosted UI to create an account or sign in

4. Verify authentication:
   - After signing in, you should see the UserButton in the header
   - Protected pages should work as expected

## Rollback Instructions

If you need to rollback to the previous Convex Auth setup:
1. Run `npm uninstall @clerk/nextjs`
2. Restore previous versions of: `middleware.ts`, `app/layout.tsx`, `app/signin/page.tsx`, `app/page.tsx`
3. Remove Clerk imports and restore Convex auth logic
