# Welcome to your Convex + Next.js + Convex Auth app

This is a [Convex](https://convex.dev/) project created with [`npm create convex`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-convex).

After the initial setup (<2 minutes) you'll have a working full-stack app using:

- Convex as your backend (database, server logic)
- [React](https://react.dev/) as your frontend (web page interactivity)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for optimized web hosting and page routing
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for building great looking accessible UI
- [Convex Auth](https://labs.convex.dev/auth) for authentication
- Google Cloud Secret Manager for secure credential storage

## Google Cloud Secret Manager Setup

This project uses Google Cloud Secret Manager to securely store user credentials for various sports card platforms. Service accounts and IAM permissions are managed by Terraform in `neonbinder_terraform/`. See `CLAUDE.md` at the repo root for the full service account reference.

For local development, use SA impersonation (org policy blocks key creation):
```bash
gcloud auth application-default login \
  --impersonate-service-account=neonbinder-convex@neonbinder.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

## Browser Service Requirement

This project uses a separate browser service for interacting with certain sports card platforms (like BuySportsCards). To test credentials for these platforms, you need to have the browser service running locally:

1. **Navigate to the browser service directory**:
   ```bash
   cd ../neonbinder_browser
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the browser service**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The browser service will run on http://localhost:8080 by default. You can configure a different URL by setting the `NEONBINDER_BROWSER_URL` environment variable in your Convex environment.

## Get started

If you just cloned this codebase and didn't use `npm create convex`, run:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

If you're reading this README on GitHub and want to use this template, run:

```
npm create convex@latest -- -t nextjs-convexauth
```
